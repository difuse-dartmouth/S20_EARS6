# Module Overview
## Module Objective 
Students will grapple with environmental change through direct collection of local data in conjunction with analysis of existing data sets.  Visualizing relationships between data allow students to make predictions and draw conclusions.

## Student Learning Objectives
1. Make actual measurements of current environmental change
2. Estimate the uncertainty associated with your measurements
3. Formulate a hypothesis as to the nature of the change
4. Test a hypothesis
5. Draw conclusions
6. Collaborate with fellow students to share data, work, and ideas
7. Communicate your findings in both written and oral form

## Module Description
Through this project, the students will have the opportunity to measure environmental change. Students will also be exposed to temperature and insolation related public datasets. The project is appropriate for courses in introductory environmental sciences, earth sciences, and any other courses related to the climate. It is designed to be done on studentsâ€™ own time outside of the classroom throughout the course of a term or semester. There is an option to use one class time to show video abstracts that students will have created by the end.

### Data
Students collect data on solar incidence angle and use public climate and weather data from Dartmouth and other sources.

### Platform
The module uses google sheets or excel to collate and analyze data.

## Schedule and Links

Use this page to get an idea of the timeline of the module, what components are involved, and what documents are related to each component. This is the schedule intended for module deployment by the DIFUSE team, though instructors are welcome to modify the timeline to fit their course environment.

### Module Outline
1. Students complete a pre-project questionnaire
2. Students work in groups to complete the term project.
3. Students take daily measurements of the incidence angle of the sun to create a data set for analysis which is stored in excel.
4. Students analyze public data on climate and insolation variable.
5. Deliverable: Preliminary data and hypothesis report (1 page)
6. Deliverable: Final Project Report (Manuscript)
7. Deliverable: Video Abstract (1-3 minutes)
8. Deliverable: Reflection (1 paragraph)

## Course Information

The module was developed for an introductory Earth Sciences course, <a href="http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Earth-Sciences/EARS-Earth-Sciences-Undergraduate/EARS-6">Environmental Change</a>, at Dartmouth College which explores natural and human induced changes to the environment.  As it is introductory, students are not expected to have any particular set of background preparation.  But for this project, it is expected that the students have familiarity with terms associated with the environment and climate. If not, some lecture time should be taken to establish knowledge of determinants of climate and weather. It will also be beneficial if the students have prior knowledge of the scientific method as they will be exercising it throughout the project.
